opendir, readdir and closedir use for getting file/directory basic information.
stat, lstat use for getting more file information.
time, ctime use for getting time (use in ls -l).


Plan
- read the subject >>> ok
- check out available command >>> ok
- implement prototype of binary tree >>> ok
- list all the behaviors of program >>> ok
- design program structure >>> ok
- implement ls -R
- implement parser
- implement printer
- handle memory leak
- handle error
- add some bonus


The program will have 3 parts
1. parser
2. inserter
3. print


Flag
mandatory
l = show more detail
R = recursive
a = show all files
r = reverse order
t = sort by mod time, new first

If there are multiple arguments, it's actually run one after the other and also show the path of each one above the result.


Criteria
- what to insert
    R = recursive (mutual)
    a = all (mutual)
    A = all but no . and .. (mutual but overwrite a)
    d = only argument path (overwrite other flags)

- data for each insert
    l = show more info (unique)
    t = need mod time
    S = need size
for optimization: if doesn't have above flag, don't run stat()

- sort by
    r = reverse (mutual)
    t = mod time (unique)
    S = size (unique)

- how to print
    l = one file per line
    1 = one file per line
    Q = add double quote to filename (mutual)
    p = add / to directory
    g = no owner
    G = no group
